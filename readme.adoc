= Ti-DHome

This is a Home automation project.

Pronounced "Ty d'Homme" stands for *little man* in French.

== Description

A home server can be put in place to monitor and act on various environment sensors.

== History

Initially, this all started in 2010 when arriving in my new home.

Room temperatures were not perfect, with high difference between rooms and strange weather-related discrepencencies.

== Goal

Room can be tracked in temperature and humidity while heaters can be switched on/off based on precise room sensor metrics.

= Design approach

This repository is an attempt to put together the source and explanation to build minimalist home automation.

Minimal approach means:

* avoid complex monolithic framework used here and there on automation
* client(s)/server(s) plugs together using *ANY* progamming language by leveraging message queues (MQTT)
* simple arduino sketches for sensors
* simple datastore (any or multiple)
* deploy as much as possible with automation using link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

= Material

Hardware used for sensors/actors:

* Arduino with radio enabled (JeeNode compatible): 15+ low cost sensors
* link:http://www.currentcost.com/product-envir.html[CurrentCost EnviR]: Main + 9 plugs
* link:http://www.rfxcom.com/[RFXtrx433]: Weather Station, Window motor openers, Alarm monitoring
* Sainsmart relay board: 16 relays
* Fanless low-consumption servers link:http://cubieboard.org[Cubieboard v2] or multi-purpose Core i3 with SSD)
* few cheap components (for téléinfo)

= Dashboard

A simple Dashboard uses Grafana and InfluxDB as storage.

= How-To

== Setup each module

Everything can be setup at need.

* link:/modules/teleinfo[Téléinfo]
* link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome-web-relay-board[Web Relays]
* link:/modules/rfxtrx433[RfxTrx433]
* link:/modules/currentcost[CurrentCost]
* link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome-sensors[Sensors]
* Database is up to user. Using CouchDB, but this is not shared for now.

== Install software

Central service is fully contained into Docker container.
The service has an inner mosquitto and uses pre-build strategies to wire-up the few modules.
Idea is to leverage link:http://nodered.org[Node RED]

* steps: 
 * install link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
 * change the below command line to map your USB devices.
 * connect to http://localhost:1880, change the project flow based on need. 

    $ git clone https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome.git
    $ docker-compose up -d

=== Used node-red nodes
