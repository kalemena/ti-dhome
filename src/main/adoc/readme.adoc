= Ti-DHome

This is a Home automation project. +
Pronounced "Ti d'Homme" in French. +
This GIT project is a hat project that integrates many devices and protocoles into an enabled Home Automation.

This project tries to offer a lot of flexibility in intergrating heterogeneous systems, while remaining simple: KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid).

Standard principles similar to IFTTT (If This Then That) can be applied, although architecture allows more flexible interoperability, yet simple-enough to understand and adapt to customized use-cases.

.Example Usage
[TIP]
====
Sensors (DIY or proprietary) are sending room temperatures, motion or doors state. +
A small and flexible Node-Red workflow allows to orchestrate heaters based on simple rules around sensors values and/or schedule and/or external weather.

.Example Usage
[TIP]
====
Sensors (DIY or proprietary) are sending power and energy consumption. +

Grafana allows to analyze and take next best improvements actions.
This is possible to enable Solar routers, etc

== Design

=== Principle

The source and explanation in this repository are following few principles:

* Avoid monolithic home automation frameworks
* Avoid using proprietary gateways named *boxes* such as any IKEA, Xiaomi, Amazon Echo, Leroy Merlin, Philips, Lidl, etc
* Use (or re-use) available technology, avoid deprecation, but stay open to new technology
* Client(s)/server(s) plugs together using *any* progamming language by leveraging message queues (MQTT) when necessary
* DIY sensors or Web devices are using simple arduino sketches (Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, etc)
* Each element (e.g. Timeseries datastore) can be any, or multiple, and are interchangeable and migration-friendly
* Deploy as much as possible with automation in mind, using link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

=== Architecture

There are only few technical concepts:

* Communication of each element from the system is done through messaging system *MQTT bus* (mosquitto)
* *Node-red* enables loosely coupled custom workflow strategies

In turns, this simplistic approach allows very flexible and powerful Home Automation.

=== Material

Hardware used for sensors/actors:

* Fanless low-consumption servers (e.g. Core i3 with SSD, or RaspberryPi, ODroid-M1S)
* link:http://www.currentcost.com/product-envir.html[CurrentCost EnviR] to measure 230v main + 9 plugs
* link:http://www.rfxcom.com/[RFXtrx433] to record Weather Station measures, trigger Window motor openers, or monitor alarm
* link:https://aeotec.com/z-wave-usb-stick/[ZWave] or link:https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2[ZigBee] USB sticks as gateways (with minimal footprint) to proprietary devices
* link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome-web-relay-board[DIY Web relays board]
* link:https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome-sensors[DIY Arduino sensors 866Mhz] (15+ low cost sensors)
* link:https://kalemena.github.io/iot-tools/#sensors_teleinfo[Téléinfo (Electric French Main power counters)]
* Few cheap components

=== Dashboards

[TIP]
====
The project allows creation of simple Dashboards using Grafana and thanks to Victoria Metrics as timeseries database.

.Power Overview
image:dashboard-power-overview.png[Dashboard Power - overview,1024]

* Now:
** *Periode* : Power cost period. "Heures Pleines" or "Heures Creuses" stands for high/low cost hours
** *Total (VA)* : Power level from Téléinfo (EDF)
** *Total (W)* : Power level from clamp
** *Consumers* : Clamp meters on various elements (Zigbee clamps onto electric car, water heater, heaters)
** *Outlets* : Wall plugs (CurrentCost or Zigbee plugs)

* Energy Overview:
** *X days* : Energy consumption (in kWh, percent, or € cost), for the selected period (1d,7d,30d,etc), and by categories
** *Total (tempo,hphc,base,kWh)* : Energy consummed by hour, or day, or week slots and for each of the 6 *Periode* costs (EDF provider contract)
** *Clamps (kWh)* : Energy consumed by devices, in kWh

.Energy Timelines
image:dashboard-power-hours.png[Dashboard Power - hours,1024]

* *Total from grid* : Energy consumed (in Wh, percent, or € cost)
* *Clamps (Wh)*: Energy consumed by devices, in Wh

TIP: The integration with Solar systems such as OpenDTU allows to view and diagnose daily production and compare grid consumption/production.

== How-To

This project can be entirely or partialy reproduced. +
Hence this is not required to buy everything above mentioned to be working for Ti-Dhome. +
If you need to control ZigBee devices, just implement relevant part of this project.

=== Setup modules

==== Orchestrator

Central to all the Orchestration of IoT is a docker container with link:http://nodered.org[Node RED]. +
Node-Red enables loosely coupled custom workflow strategies. +
IoT devices can therefore be wired from monitoring to action. +
Node-Red is like the advanced modern IFTTT (If This Then That) service, with much much more powerful integration capabilities, at the cost a requiring a little bit more effort to use :-)

Because Ti-Dhome requires few defaults and libs installed, a specific Docker version is cooked. +
Check link:https://github.com/kalemena/docker-node-red[Ti-Dhome - Docker Node-Red (external git project)]

==== Databases & Monitoring

Use any, as appropriate for your use-case. +
Ti-Dhome uses link:https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics[Victoria Metrics] to store Timeseries on sensors metrics. +

Victoria Metrics is generally used in stack with monitoring of system, with link:https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf[Telegraf] and link:https://grafana.com/[Grafana]. +

==== IoT Gateways

Here are gateways integrated OK in Ti-Dhome:

* link:https://kalemena.github.io/iot-tools/#sensors_teleinfo[Gateway USB Téléinfo]
* link:https://kalemena.github.io/iot-tools/#gateways_zigbee[ZigBee (example usage for Ti-DHome)]
* link:https://kalemena.github.io/iot-tools/#gateways_z_wave[ZWave (example usage for Ti-DHome)]

=== Deployment

* install link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker]
* clone this repository

    $ git clone https://github.com/kalemena/ti-dhome.git
    $ cd ti-dhome/src

* edit the docker-compose.yml to map your USB gateway devices.

* initialize few folders and config

    $ make init

* start Node-RED

    $ make start

** connect to link:http://localhost:1880[], change the project flow.
